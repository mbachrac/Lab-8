#Answers for Lab 8

**1** If I try a treeMap instead of a hashMap the tests and main run the same.

**2** When I called countWords for the first iterator and list, it worked, but when I added another list and iterator onto the same map, it combined the two lists of words together and put them into the same map. The test that I set up failed because it was counting the words from the first iterator along with the ones that belong to the second iterator. When I used a different map, iterator, and list, it worked.
